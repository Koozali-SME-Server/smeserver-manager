        Welcome to SME Server, the leading Linux distribution for
        small and medium enterprises. SME Server is brought to
        you by <A HREF="https://www.koozali.org/" TARGET="_blank">Koozali Foundation, Inc.</A>,
        a non-profit corporation that exists to provide marketing and
        legal support for SME Server.
        </p>

        <p>
        SME Server is freely available under the GNU General Public
        License and is only possible through the efforts of the SME
        Server community.  However, the availability and quality of SME
        Server is dependent on meeting our expenses, such as hosting
        costs, server hardware, etc.
        </p>


        <p>
        As such, we ask for a donation to offset costs and fund
        further development.
        </p>

        <p>
        a) If you are a school, a church, a non-profit organisation or an
        individual using SME for private purposes, we would appreciate you to
        contribute within your means toward the costs associated with hosting,
        maintenance and development.
        </p>

        <p>
        b) If you are a company or an integrator and you are deploying SME in
        the course of your work to generate revenue, we expect you to make a
        donation commensurate with the level of revenue you generate and the
        number of servers your have in the field. Please, help the project
        </p>
