'pse_DESCRIPTION' => '<p>The server automatically creates
an e-mail alias for each group. If you want to define an e-mail
alias for a list of users, simply create a group and the
list will automatically be maintained by the server.</p>
<p>Pseudonyms allow you to
create other names for existing users or groups.
For example, you may wish to create a pseudonym
"webmaster" for your "webdevelopers" group or a
pseudonym "joe" for the user "joseph".</p>
<p>The server automatically creates pseudonyms of the form
firstname. lastname and firstname_lastname for every user
on the system and a pseudonym "everyone" which contains
all users on the system.</p>
<p>Pseudonyms also allow you to create e-mail aliases for valid
(virtual) domains & users. For example you can forward
"sales@virtualdomain1.com" to user "mary" and 
"sales@virtualdomain2.com" to user "john".
You must create the domains and user accounts before creating
the email aliases.</p>
<p>Pseudonyms can also forward to other pseudonyms, although this
is limited to one further level. For example the pseudonym
"webmaster" can forward to the pseudonym "techsupport" which
then forwards to a specified user "ray". This is useful where
one user is responsiblefor multiple roles and saves having
to change the pseudonym"s associated with that user many times
in the event that the user departs the organisation.</p>
<p>You can modify or remove a
pseudonym by clicking on the corresponding
command next to the pseudonym.</p>',
