proxy settings.
The server includes a transparent proxy and cache for 
HTTP traffic. This is enabled by default, but not enforced 
if the server is in &quot;serveronly&quot; mode. 
If this server is acting as an e-mail server, connections 
from local network clients to external SMTP servers 
will default to being redirected to the local e-mail server.',

from infected client hosts by forcing all outgoing SMTP traffic

If you wish to use an alternate SMTP server, and this server is 
your gateway to it, set this proxy to "disabled". Setting the 
proxy to "blocked" prevents all SMTP traffic to other servers, 
this is the default. The proxy only intercepts/blocks normal smtp 
(port 25) traffic.',
