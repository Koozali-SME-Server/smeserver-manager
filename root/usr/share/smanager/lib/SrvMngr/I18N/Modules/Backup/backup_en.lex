file\" option can be used to check the integrity of a desktop backup

<P>The tape backup method uses a software package called <I>[_2]</I>
to back up your entire hard disk to tape every night. This requires a
supported tape drive and a tape that is not write-protected. The backup
is performed automatically at the selected time every night (with a
reminder automatically e-mailed to the administrator during the day).

to back up your entire hard disk to tape every night. This requires a

<P>Workstation backup. This method uses a software package called <I>dar</I>
to back up your server configuration and data files to a network share 
or a local removable disk such as a USB disk. 
You can manage how many rotating sets of backups are kept,
and how many incremental backups to have in each set. 
The backup is performed automatically at the selected time every day. Currently 
configuration and data files total approximately <b>[_3]</b> uncompressed.
Twice the compressed data size must be available on the backup share.</P>
<P>Backup to Desktop. This method creates a copy of your server 
configuration and user data files, and downloads it to your 
local desktop via your web browser.
Currently your configuration and data files total approximately
<b>[_3]</b>. The backup file will be somewhat less than this,
depending on how much the data can be compressed. 
This file can be used to restore the server from the console if you 
copy it to a local removable disk such as a USB disk.</P>
<P>All backup methods allow you to restore your configuration and user
data files. Workstation backup provides individual file restore. <b>Ideally, 
full restore should be performed on a freshly installed server</b>.</P>',
